HKTVmall & Amazon Skincare Product Analysis

The aim of this project is to extract data from E-commerce websites via web scraping and analyse the data to produce actionable insights. The data was collected using Selenium and BeautifulSoup then subsequently processed and analysed using Pandas and Seaborn. We chose HKTVmall as the primary source because it is the largest e-commerce business in Hong Kong, while Amazon is also used as a source of comparison, being the largest player in the global market.

The Notebooks 1-2 contain code for web scraping and cleaning of data for all skincare products from HKTVmall. 2-4 is the same but for only male skincare products from HKTVmall. Notebook 5 then combines the dataframes to sort the products by gender. Notebooks 6-7 contain code for web scraping and data cleaning for Amazon. Lastly, notebook 8 contains data visualisations, which were used to identify trends and insights.

The file 'webscraping.pdf' summarises this projects and provides business recommendations based on insights driven from the data analysis. It also elaborates on
challenges and future improvements of this project.
